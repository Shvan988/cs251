			<h2 id="Prospero">Prospero</h2>
			<p>The play's protagonist and Miranda's father. Usurped and
				exiled by his brother Antonio, the duke of Milan.</p>


			<h2 id="Miranda">Miranda</h2>
			<p>Prospero's daughter, whom he brought with him to the island
				when she was still a small child. Miranda has never seen any men
				other than her father and Caliban.</p>


			<h2 id="Ariel">Ariel</h2>
			<p>Prospero's spirit helper, a powerful supernatural being whom
				Prospero controls completely. Rescued by Prospero from a long
				imprisonment (within a tree) at the hands of the witch Sycorax.</p>


			<h2 id="Caliban">Caliban</h2>
			<p>Another of Prospero's servants. Caliban, the son of the
				now-deceased witch Sycorax, acquainted Prospero with the island when
				Prospero arrived.</p>

			<h2 id="Ferdinand">Ferdinand</h2>
			<p>Son and heir of Alonso, the King of Naples. He falls in love
				with Miranda and happily submits to servitude in order to win her
				father's approval.</p>

			<p>King of Naples and father of Ferdinand. Alonso aided Antonio
				in unseating Prospero as duke of Milan twelve years earlier.</p>

				trust and stole his dukedom years before the play begins.</p>

				underhanded.</p>

				title.</p>
