			<h2>
				<b>GONZALO</b> [To ALONSO]
			</h2>
			<p>
				<a href="commentary#1">1</a> By'r lakin, I can go no further, sir;
				My old bones ache: here's a maze trod indeed <a href="commentary#3">3</a>
				Through forth-rights and meanders! By your patience, I needs must
				rest me.
			</p>

			<h2>
				<b>ALONSO</b>
			</h2>
			<p>
				Old lord, I cannot blame thee, <a href="commentary#5">5</a> Who am
				myself attach'd with weariness, <a href="commentary#6">6</a> To the
				dulling of my spirits: sit down, and rest. <a href="commentary#7">7</a>
				Even here I will put off my hope and keep it <a href="commentary#8">8</a>
				No longer for my flatterer: he is drown'd Whom thus we stray to
				find, and the sea mocks <a href="commentary#10">10</a> Our frustrate
				search on land. Well, let him go.
			</p>

			<h2>
				<b>ANTONIO</b> [Aside to SEBASTIAN]
			</h2>
			<p>
				I am right glad that he's so out of hope. <a href="commentary#12">12</a>
				Do not, for one repulse, forego the purpose That you resolved to
				effect.
			</p>

			<h2>
				<b>SEBASTIAN</b> [Aside to ANTONIO]
			</h2>
			<p>The next advantage Will we take throughly.</p>

			<h2>
				<b>ANTONIO</b> [Aside to SEBASTIAN]
			</h2>
			<p>
				Let it be to-night; <a href="commentary#15">15</a> For, now they are
				oppress'd with travail, they Will not, nor cannot, use such
				vigilance As when they are fresh.
			</p>

			<h2>
				<b>SEBASTIAN</b> [Aside to ANTONIO]
			</h2>
			<p>I say, to-night: no more.</p>

			Solemn and strange music ALONSO
			<p>What harmony is this? My good friends, hark!</p>

			<h2>
				<b>GONZALO</b>
			</h2>
			<p>Marvellous sweet music!</p>


			[Enter PROSPERO above, invisible. Enter several strange Shapes,
			bringing in a banquet; they dance about it with gentle actions of
			salutation; and, inviting the King and company to eat, they depart]

			<h2>
				<b>ALONSO</b>
			</h2>
			<p>
				<a href="commentary#20">20</a> Give us kind keepers, heavens! What
				were these?
			</p>

			<h2>
				<b>SEBASTIAN</b>
			</h2>
			<p>
				<a href="commentary#21">21</a> A living drollery. Now I will believe
				That there are unicorns, that in Arabia There is one tree, the
				phoenix' throne, one phoenix At this hour reigning there.
			</p>

			<h2>
				<b>ANTONIO</b>
			</h2>
			<p>
				I'll believe both; <a href="commentary#25">25</a> And what does else
				want credit, come to me, <a href="commentary#26">26</a> And I'll be
				sworn 'tis true: travellers ne'er did lie, Though fools at home
				condemn 'em. GONZALO If in Naples I should report this now, would
				they believe me? If I should say, I saw such islanders-- <a
					href="commentary#30">30</a> For, certes, these are people of the
				island-- Who, though they are of monstrous shape, yet, note, <a
					href="commentary#32">32</a> Their manners are more gentle-kind than
				of Our human generation you shall find Many, nay, almost any.
			</p>
			<h2>
				<b>PROSPERO</b> [Aside]
			</h2>
			<p>Honest lord, Thou hast said well; for some of you there
				present Are worse than devils.</p>
